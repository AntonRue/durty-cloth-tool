# Open Source Code outdated
My last public commit to this project was on April 2021, since then I have started to rewrite this tool due to high demands for a more professional software with much more features. 

This new version, next generation, is known as **Durty Cloth Tool** and a very popular tool for helping you out with all your GTA V cloth modding needs. As the development, support and maintaining of such a feature rich tool is very time consuming, it has been a licensed software since then.

Feel free to check it out, thanks for all the support ‚ù§
